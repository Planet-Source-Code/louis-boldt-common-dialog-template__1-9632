## Common Dialog Template


</div>

### Description

Common Dialog Template. This small project explores the use of the Show methods of the Common Dialog. Want to know if the user entered

an unexpected extention? Want the dialog to return a file name that does or does not exist? I have included most of the

constants and properties associated with each method; not so much to show how they are use, but as a reminder of what is there.

Try different things and see what happens.

The open and save methods seem to have the most options and therefore the most complexity. So have fun and see if this works with that....
